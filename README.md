# Postman Collection Multiline Search and Replace
Postman's global search/replace does not work for multiline replacements. This small javascript tool fills that gap.

# Online Version
Use it directly at https://www.ullright.org/tools/postman-search-replace/postman-search-replace.html

# Usage
- Export your collection in Postman
- Open .json collection in text editor
- Copy the content and paste it into the tool
- Use the tool to search and replace
- Copy content back to the .json collection file and save
- Re-import the collection into postman

# TODO
- regex replace support
