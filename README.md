# Postman Collection Multiline Search and Replace
Postman's global search/replace does not work for multiline replacements. This small javascript tool fills that gap.

# Usage
- Export your collection in Postman
- Open .json collection in text editor
- Copy the content and paste it into the tool
- Use the tool to search and replace
- Copy content back to the .json collection file and save
- Re-import the colelction into postman

# TODO
- regex replace support
